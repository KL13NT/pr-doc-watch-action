# Documentation Link Checker

A GitHub Action that scans pull request files for links in code comments.
Helps members on the team to always keep documentation up to date.

## Use case

I tend to link documentation (either markdown files or confluence) in code
comments in my code. This helps me reach documentation faster, but often gets
missed when other people update files that link to documentation. 

This action hopefully eliminates this headache, since you now get a tiny report
listing all links in the doc that you need to review as part of your change.

> [!WARNING]  
> This action is for pull-requests only. Using it in other types of workflows
> will fail. 

> [!NOTE]  
> I have the action configured to always exit with code 0, even in errors, to
> prevent it from stopping your workflows. I also recommend passing `continue-on-error`.

## Usage

In your pull request workflow file, add the following:

```yaml
jobs:
    steps:
      # ...
      - name: Check documentation links
        uses: kl13nt/pr-doc-watch-action@v1.0.0
        continue-on-error: true
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      # ...
```

## Inputs

| Input           | Description                    | Required | Default               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | -------- | --------------------- |
| `github-token`  | GitHub token for API access    | No       | `${{ github.token }}` |
